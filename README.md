# Guidelines

This folder contains several **"starter notebooks"** with some basic code to help you get started with the datathon. The notebooks cover a wide range of topics we think will be relevant for you to make your submissions. All the content in this is free to use, however there are a few pointers we would like you to keep in your mind:

1. There will be NO EXTRA ADVANTAGE for using the code in these starter notebooks
2. The starter notebooks only contain basic examples
3. The main purpose of this starter kit is to help you learn if you are unfamiliar with data science
4. We have taken great care to create this kit. However, if you find a bug, kindly let the team know about it
5. If you choose to share this kit on any other public platform, please provide credit to the LSESU Data Science Society
